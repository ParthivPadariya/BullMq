Hear We Have Implement Scalable Mail send system using Queut=e Data Stracture in Redis

In this we Have Use BullMq
BullMQ is a lightweight, robust, and fast NodeJS library for creating background jobs and sending messages using queues. BullMQ is designed to be easy to use, but also powerful and highly configurable. It is backed by Redis, which makes it easy to scale horizontally and process jobs across multiple servers.

And Also use Redis for fast response time 

Redis is an open-source, in-memory data structure store. It serves as a high-performance key-value database, caching layer, and message broker. Redis is designed for speed and simplicity, offering exceptional performance for read and write operations.

In-Memory Storage:
Redis stores data in RAM, allowing for extremely fast read and write operations. This makes it suitable for use cases that require low-latency data access.

Pub/Sub Messaging:
Redis includes a publish/subscribe messaging paradigm, allowing different parts of an application or different applications to communicate in a decoupled manner.
